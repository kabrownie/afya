        If you have ever gone out of your way to do a good deed for another, you know the amazing feeling that follows.   Doing something nice for someone else is a scientifically proven, positive way to enjoy a rush of feel good emotions and all the benefits that accompany them.  It lowers stress levels, helps keep mental health strong, and can even extend life expectancy!  Of course, seeking out opportunities to help others is often easier said than done, particularly when you take busy work and family schedules and responsibilities into account.  Fortunately, there is always at least one good deed that nearly anyone can do at nearly any time that suits their schedule–blood donation.

        <h1><span> Benefits of Blood Donation</span></h1>
        <P>Every year, nearly 5 million people receive life-saving blood transfusions, a process which would not be possible without active donors.  Blood banks rely on the donations of all different blood types in order to remain fully stocked and ready when blood is needed by anyone for any reason from accident and injury to surgery.  Furthermore, the act of donating blood provides a multitude of benefits to the donor.  Here are a few:</P>
        <ol>
        <li> 
            <h2>Your Blood Could Save Multiple Lives</h2>
        </li>
            <p>Most people envision their blood going to a single individual of the same blood type.  But, in reality, one donation could save up to three lives!  There are times when patients need a transfusion of whole blood, but there are others where only certain components of blood are needed.  For this reason, blood banks are able to extend the usefulness of each donation by separating them into red cells, platelets, and plasma, each of which could potentially go to a different patient.</p>
            <li>
        <h2>
            You’ll get a Check of Your Health with Blood Donation
        </h2>
            </li>
        <p>
            Before giving blood, each donor must undergo a minor health check that includes pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, and iron levels.  But, it doesn’t end there.  After your blood has been collected, it is sent to a lab where further testing is conducted.  In total, your blood will be checked for 13 infectious diseases such as West Nile and HIV, and should any of these tests return a positive result, you will be notified immediately.

        </p>
        <li>
        <h2>
            Blood Donation can Improve Your Overall Health
        </h2>
        </li>
        <p>
            Not only does donating blood help save lives, help monitor your health, and make you feel good, it could also offer some long-term benefits to your physical health.  The process has been shown capable of helping improve blood flow in some, resulting in healthier blood vessels and a lower likelihood of arterial blockages.  Likewise, the regulation and balance of iron levels that comes from blood donation is another perk leading to stronger blood vessels.  Perhaps this is why research has indicated that blood donors are 88 percent less likely than others to suffer a heart attack!
            
            <br>
             it comes to good deeds, there are few that have as many benefits for as many people as the simple act of blood donation.  If you are looking for a way to give back to your community and to help improve the lives of others (and yourself), this is a perfect solution.

            Many Kenyans are ignorant on the blood donation process and are not sensitized on the dire blood need the country is facing.As a result Kenya has had shortages of human blood in its hospitals - sometimes forcing relatives and friends to put out calls for people to donate. The Kenya National Blood Transfusion Service (KNBTS) disclosed that it used to collect about 450 pints of blood every day. However, with the onset of COVID-19 in the country, the situation has changed, and the figures have dropped between 70 and 80 percent.
            So as an attempt to try as much as possible to collect more pints all hospitals have been enlisted to be blood donation centtres.
            <br>
            In addition to this many Organisations such as schools, institutions, banks etc have been funding and hosting blood driven campaigns. This campaigns occur within the vicinity of this organisations and are available to all.
            We as the Afya Blood Group have vouched to sensitize the public when such campaigns are held as displayed on our website.

           Lack of public awareness has been a major contributor to poor numbers of blood donation.This occurs due to many myths and misconceptions which bias on who should donate blood. We have heard of cases where some people never donate blood since they have been told that they are overweight whereas as that might not be scientifically correct.
           There are various blood donation types and with them come different requirements
           The major blood donations include:
          </p>
           
               <li>One must weigh atleast 110lbs or 50Kg.</li>
               <li>One must be of good health / feeling well.</li>
               <li>One must be of atleast 16 years of age and not older than 65 years.</li>
           
            <p> 
                 requirements are specified depending on the blood donation type

            Whole Blood Donation
        </h3></li>
        <p>
        A whole blood (WB) donation is the most common form of blood donation, in which a person gives one pint of blood.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Requirements for Whole Blood Donation
        </h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Donation frequency: Every 56 days, up to 6 times a year</li>
        <li> must be in good health and feeling well</li>
        <li> must be at least 16 years </li>

        <p>
            Is the donation of blood platelets.

            <h5>
                What are platelets used for ?
            </h5>
            <p>
        Platelets, which come from bone marrow, help to induce clotting and control bleeding. Patients who have been treated for leukemia with chemotherapy, for example, will often need to be transfused platelets.
        </p>
        <!-- <h5>
             is the process of donating platelets
         </h5> -->
         <p> 
             During a platelet donation, we will collect one, two, or three units of platelets. One of our medical technicians will recommend the number of units based on your weight, hemoglobin level and platelet count that day.
         </p>
         <h4>
             Requirements for Platelets Donation

         <li><h3> AB Elite Plasma Donation</h3></li>
         <p>
             This is donation of plasma by people with blood type AB+ or AB-

         </p>
         <h5>
             What is Plasma used for ?
         </h5>
         <p>
         Much like platelets, plasma helps to induce clotting and control bleeding. However, it does this through different mechanisms and many of the clotting factors found in plasma are made from the liver.  Therefore, although both plasma and platelets both help to control bleeding, they are sometimes used for different patient populations, depending on what the patient’s underlying disease.
         </p>

                </h3>
            </li>
         <h5>
             What is double red blood cell donation?
             </h5>
         <p> 
             A double red blood cell donation, a machine is used to withdraw whole blood. Red cells are separated and retained, and the remainder of the blood is returned back to the donor. This donation safely removes twice as many red cells than traditional whole blood. We refer to this as a double red blood cell donation, or DRBC for short. 
         </p>
         <h5>
             What are red blood cells used for? 
         </h5>
         <p>
             Red blood cells transport oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and remove carbon dioxide and waste. Red blood cells are indicated for more than 70% of all transfusions. Patients who lose or at risk of losing significant volumes of blood require red blood cell transfusions.  This population includes patients who have suffered severe trauma, have a perforated bleeding ulcer, or who are undergoing a major surgical procedure.

         </p>
