            Many Kenyans are ignorant on the blood donation process and are not sensitized on the dire blood need the country is facing.As a result Kenya has had shortages of human blood in its hospitals - sometimes forcing relatives and friends to put out calls for people to donate. The Kenya National Blood Transfusion Service (KNBTS) disclosed that it used to collect about 450 pints of blood every day. However, with the onset of COVID-19 in the country, the situation has changed, and the figures have dropped between 70 and 80 percent.
            So as an attempt to try as much as possible to collect more pints all hospitals have been enlisted to be blood donation centtres.
            <br>
            In addition to this many Organisations such as schools, institutions, banks etc have been funding and hosting blood driven campaigns. This campaigns occur within the vicinity of this organisations and are available to all.
            We as the Afya Blood Group have vouched to sensitize the public when such campaigns are held as displayed on our website.
