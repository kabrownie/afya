           Lack of public awareness has been a major contributor to poor numbers of blood donation.This occurs due to many myths and misconceptions which bias on who should donate blood. We have heard of cases where some people never donate blood since they have been told that they are overweight whereas as that might not be scientifically correct.
           There are various blood donation types and with them come different requirements
           The major blood donations include:
          </p>
           
               <li>One must weigh atleast 110lbs or 50Kg.</li>
               <li>One must be of good health / feeling well.</li>
               <li>One must be of atleast 16 years of age and not older than 65 years.</li>

            Whole Blood Donation

        A whole blood (WB) donation is the most common form of blood donation, in which a person gives one pint of blood.

                What are platelets used for ?
            </h5>
            <p>
        Platelets, which come from bone marrow, help to induce clotting and control bleeding. Patients who have been treated for leukemia with chemotherapy, for example, will often need to be transfused platelets.
        </p>

         <p> t
             During a platelet donation, we will collect one, two, or three units of platelets. One of our medical technicians will recommend the number of units based on your weight, hemoglobin level and platelet count that day.

             What is Plasma used for ?
         </h5>
         <p>
         Much like platelets, plasma helps to induce clotting and control bleeding. However, it does this through different mechanisms and many of the clotting factors found in plasma are made from the liver.  Therefore, although both plasma and platelets both help to control bleeding, they are sometimes used for different patient populations, depending on what the patientâ€™s underlying disease.

                 Power Red or Double Red Blood Cell Donation (DRBC)

         <h5>
             What is double red blood cell donation?
             </h5>
         <p> 
             A double red blood cell donation, a machine is used to withdraw whole blood. Red cells are separated and retained, and the remainder of the blood is returned back to the donor. This donation safely removes twice as many red cells than traditional whole blood. We refer to this as a double red blood cell donation, or DRBC for short. 
         </p>
         <h5>
             What are red blood cells used for? 
         </h5>
         <p>
             Red blood cells transport oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and remove carbon dioxide and waste. Red blood cells are indicated for more than 70% of all transfusions. Patients who lose or at risk of losing significant volumes of blood require red blood cell transfusions.  This population includes patients who have suffered severe trauma, have a perforated bleeding ulcer, or who are undergoing a major surgical procedure.
